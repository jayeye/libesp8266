# Libraries for use with the ESP8266

To install any of these libraries, make symlinks from your `Arduino/libraries` directory to
each directory under `libraries`.

Unit tests, where present, usually expect  [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).

Hopefully these will work with other Arduino boards. Submit patches if you use them!

Also look in [https://github.com/jayeye/libardji](https://github.com/jayeye/libardji) for more generic Arduino code.
